Simply awesome project management in Atom.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehcode/atom-project-plus/master/project-plus.gif)

You may be thinking.. Yet another project manager (for atom)? Atom contains a
lot of piping to make project management awesome. It's missing those few bits
that expose that awesome to users. This is that package.

 - **No configuration** — atom was already keeping track of your projects

 - **No mess** (project files) — atom already knows about your projects and their needs (and is planning to know more)

 - **No weirdness** — switching between projects (in the same window) is done correctly and does not corrupt state (unlike every existing project package I've seen)

 - Fully supports projects with multiple paths

## Usage

 - `ctrl-alt-p` (linux/windows) or `ctrl-cmd-p` (mac) to open the project finder
 - `enter` will open the project in the current window
 - `shift-enter` will open the project in a new window

## Installation

```
apm install project-plus
```
